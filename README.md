# CritCompendium
Crit Compendium is a content creation and management tool for D&amp;D 5th Edition. The complete 5.1 SRD 
is included with support for importing your existing XML compendiums.

Crit Compendium is currently in active development and working toward version 2.0. The original release is available 
for free on Steam as [Critical Compendium](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1087080/Critical_Compendium/).

However, this project is branching off from the original release and will 
continue as an open source project.

##### 2.0 features I'm working toward:

- [x] Rebranding (previously Critical Compendium)
- [x] Character export overhaul.
- [x] Theme support.
- [x] Encounter difficulty estimate improvements.
- [x] Add condition management to encounter creatures.
- [x] Random encounter generator.
- [x] New dialog for add/subtract.
- [x] Performance improvements.
- [ ] UI/UX improvements (partially complete).
- [ ] Add tag system to organize all entries (partially complete).
- [ ] Add Adventures (partially complete).
- [ ] Add Locations (partially complete).
- [ ] Add NPCs (partially complete).
- [ ] Add Tables (partially complete).
- [ ] Save file overhaul (lots of work to do here).
- [ ] Installer/uninstaller (previously not needed because Steam).


And stretch goals that I would really like to see by the next release:

- [ ] \(Optional) Forms for creating/editing everything (remove all XML editing from the program).
- [ ] \(Optional) Unit tests!
- [ ] \(Optional) General cleanup, consistency improvements, reduce duplication, etc.


## Getting Started

Releases will be made available as development comes to a logical and reasonably stable stopping point. 
Until 2.0 is nearing completion builds will simply be a zip file containing all assemblies.

## Development and Contributions

Crit Compendium is developed using WPF with .Net Framework 4.8 for front the end project. The infrastructure 
project is .Net Standard 2.0. Setting up a development environment is as simple as installing Visual Studio 
2019 and opening the solution.

If you're interested in the project and would like to contribute, please let me know! I'll take some time 
and setup *contribution guidelines*.
